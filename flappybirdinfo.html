        <h2>ABOUT FLAPPY BIRD:</h2>
    <br><br>
        
       <h2> Goal:</h2>  In Flappy Bird, the player controls a bird that moves 
        through a series of pipes. The goal is to navigate the 
        bird through the gaps between the pipes by tapping the 
        screen or pressing a button to make the bird flap its wings.
         The objective is to travel as far as possible without
        colliding with the pipes. The game ends when the bird hits 
        a pipe or the ground.
        <br><br>
        <h2> Flappy Bird is a side-scrolling mobile game where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between rows of green pipes without hitting them. Here's how it generally works:</h2>
        <br><br>
        <b>1. Starting the Game:</b> The game begins with a bird positioned on the left side of the screen. Pipes with gaps in between them appear on the screen, forming obstacles for the bird.
        <br><br>
        <b>2. Controls:</b> The player taps the screen to make the bird flap its wings, causing it to ascend slightly. Each tap represents a single flap/jump.
        <br><br>
        <b>3. Flight:</b> The bird's default motion is a gradual descent. By tapping, the player helps the bird navigate through the gaps in the pipes.
        <br><br>
        <b>4. Obstacles:</b> The challenge lies in timing the bird's flaps to avoid colliding with the pipes. If the bird hits a pipe or touches the ground or the ceiling, the game ends.
        <br><br>
        <b>5. Scoring:</b> Players earn points for each set of pipes successfully passed through. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible by navigating the bird through as many pipes as they can.
        <br><br>
        <b>6. End Game:</b> When the bird collides with an obstacle, the game ends. Players can then see their final score and are often given the option to play again.
        <br><br>
        Flappy Bird's addictive nature comes from its simple controls paired with challenging gameplay, requiring precise timing and quick reflexes to keep the bird flying for as long as possible.
