# GVerse
"My project is called GVerse, a web-based game platform designed to run on browsers using standard web technologies. It includes three classic games: Snake, Tic Tac Toe, and Flappy Bird. These games are simple, entertaining, and accessible to users without requiring any special setup or installation. The goal of this project was to provide a nostalgic gaming experience while making it widely available for all types of users.
 
For the frontend, I used HTML and CSS for the structure and design, while JavaScript was used to implement the game logic and interactivity."


"The backend was developed using PHP to handle user authentication and data processing. We also used MySQL as the database to store user information, high scores, and feedback."

Features:
"The project includes ;
1. user authentication to ensure secure access

  2.  A leaderboard for high scores to engage players.

3.A feedback system for users to share their thoughts about the games."
