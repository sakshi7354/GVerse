            <h2>The goals of the Snake game, Tic-Tac-Toe, and Flappy Bird game are as follows:</h2>
    
    <h1>Snake Game:</h1>
    
    Goal: The player controls a snake that moves around a grid.
        The objective is to eat food items that appear on the 
        grid to make the snake grow longer. The game continues
        until the snake either collides with the game boundaries or itself.
    
    <h1>Tic-Tac-Toe:</h1>
    
    Goal: Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid.
         The players take turns marking a space with their respective 
         symbols (usually 'X' for one player and 'O' for the other).
          The goal is to get three of their symbols in a row, either
        horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game ends 
        when one player achieves this goal or when the grid is filled, 
        resulting in a draw.
    
    <h1>Flappy Bird:</h1>
    
    Goal: In Flappy Bird, the player controls a bird that moves 
        through a series of pipes. The goal is to navigate the 
        bird through the gaps between the pipes by tapping the 
        screen or pressing a button to make the bird flap its wings.
         The objective is to travel as far as possible without
        colliding with the pipes. The game ends when the bird hits 
        a pipe or the ground.
    
    These games are simple yet challenging, often designed to be easy to understand but
      difficult to master, providing players with an engaging and entertaining experience.
