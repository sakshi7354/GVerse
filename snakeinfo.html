        <h1>About Snake Game:</h1>
        <br><br>
       <h2> Goal:</h2> The player controls a snake that moves around a grid.
            The objective is to eat food items that appear on the 
            grid to make the snake grow longer. The game continues
            until the snake either collides with the game boundaries or itself.
        <br><br>
        <h2>The Snake Game is a classic game where a player controls a snake that moves around a bounded area, aiming to eat food pellets while avoiding collisions with itself or the boundaries. Here's how it typically works:</h2>
    <br>
    1. <b>Initialization:</b> The game starts with a snake (usually a single unit) and a piece of food within a defined area.
    <br><br>
    2. <b>Movement:</b> The snake moves continuously in the direction it's facing. The player can change its direction using arrow keys or other controls.
    <br><br>
    3. <b>Eating: </b>When the snake's head touches a food pellet, it "eats" it, making the snake longer. This increases the score.
    <br><br>
    4. <b>Collision:</b> If the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the game area, the game ends.
    <br><br>
    5. <b>Speed Increase:</b> As the game progresses or the snake grows longer, the game might speed up to increase difficulty.
    <br><br>
    6. <b>Scoring:</b> Typically, the score increases with each food pellet eaten.
    <br><br>
    7. <b>End Game:</b> The game ends when the snake collides, and the final score is displayed.
    <br><br>
    This basic structure forms the core of most snake games. Variations may include power-ups, different levels, or additional obstacles to make the game more challenging and engaging.
